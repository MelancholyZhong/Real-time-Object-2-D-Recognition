# ðŸ¤– Real-time-Object-2-D-Recognition

The objective of the project is to develop an object recognition system capable of identifying a set of specified objects in real-time from a camera looking down onto a white surface. The system should differentiate objects based on their 2D shape and a uniform dark color, regardless of their position, scale, or rotation. By completing each of the five tasks, the project aims to create an efficient and effective object recognition system that could be used in a variety of applications.
